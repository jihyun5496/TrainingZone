  <p>&lt;Park Ji Hyun &amp; jc314278 &gt; </p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The Training Zone web site is intended to increase revenue for Training Zone by prompting the services offered by the company abd increasing new and repeat customers.</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Other advertising willl be consistent for a period of 3 months(except for including the new web site), so that any increase in sale should be attributable to the site. At the end of this 3 month period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted and compared to the previous 3 months.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Target Audience will be local residents, mostly between the ages of 28 and 50 forming the majority of our current audience (mature age job seekers), and this is who the site is aimed at.</p>
